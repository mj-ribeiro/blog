### Misallocation of talent, human capital formation, and development in Brazil


We study talent allocation in an economy where teachers play a crucial role in forming
the workforce’s human capital. We define a Roy model with an externality in the occupational choice because teachers’ 
quantity and quality are essential to workers’ human capital. Then, when individuals with more abilities choose to become teachers, 
all workforce benefits. However, in our model, individuals’ occupational decisions are distorted
by frictions in the labor and educational goods markets, which may cause a misallocation
of talent and harm economic growth and development. After calibrating the model to
the Brazilian economy, we find that removing the friction in the labor market increase
the Brazilian income by 16.94%. Also, if we assume that the barriers to becoming a
teacher across the Brazilian regions are equal to the state with the highest average teachers’ human capital, 
GDP would increase by 87.85% due to externalities of the teacher’s
occupation.
