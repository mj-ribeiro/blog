title: Sobre Marcos Júnio Ribeiro
---

I'm an economist and I'm doing a PhD in applied economics at FEARP USP.
I currently work at Agromove as an economist and data scientist. 
Although my main fields of interest are Macroeconomics, Economic Growth and Development,
and Computational Economics. I am also interested in applied econometrics, 
specifically to evaluate public policies.
